# Mini-Project-Web-Usage-Analysis

The project includes the implementation of Closed Sequential pattern mining algorithm (CloSpan) using Sequential pattern mining framework. This algorithm takes the Weblog file as the input which we need to reformat it to algorithm required format. The output of the algorithm is the interested closed sequences generated by fixing some threshold value, which are remapped to Weblog file to discover interesting usage patterns from Web data.
